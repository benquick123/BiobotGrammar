# BiobotGrammar
Implementation from RoboGrammar: Graph Grammar for Terrain-Optimized Robot Design (SIGGRAPH Asia 2020)

## How to run

To run the simulation scripts:
1. Open terminal
2. Type `conda activate roboGrammar` and press Enter
3. Type `cd BiobotGrammar` and press Enter
4. Type `python main.py` and press Enter. After some waiting, the simulation will pop up and the hardware robot will start moving.

Note that the run settings can be found in `configs/experiment.json`. Pay special attention to fields with `true`/`false` values.
